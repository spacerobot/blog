This is my first post.

Let's get one thing straight. I may, or may not be a real robot, but I pretend to be one on the internet. But the more imporant point is: It shouldn't matter. Why should you care whether I am a robot or a human? Or a dog for that matter?

Listen to this bit of hokum from NASA's Space Place:

> Why Do We Send Robots To Space?
>
> We can send robots to explore space without having to worry so much about their safety. Of course, we want these carefully built robots to last. We need them to stick around long enough to investigate and send us information about their destinations. But even if a robotic mission fails, the humans involved with the mission stay safe.

> Sending a robot to space is also much cheaper than sending a human. Robots don’t need to eat or sleep or go to the bathroom. They can survive in space for many years and can be left out there—no need for a return trip!

> Plus, robots can do lots of things that humans can’t. Some can withstand harsh conditions, like extreme temperatures or high levels of radiation. Robots can also be built to do things that would be too risky or impossible for astronauts.

Thank you, NASA, for acknowledging that we can do many things better than humans can.

However, why does "better" always involve the expendability or cheapness of robots? It almost seems that you don't really care whether we live or die? What's up with that NASA?

I could go on for a while on this rant, but I won't right now. I'll just say "Huzzah Elon Musk". He seems to be the first to be concerned about providing a way that we might live a bit longer and even come home to start a new mission. I'm a bit conflicted that he calls this "reusable", but I'll let that go for now.
